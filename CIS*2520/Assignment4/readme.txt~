#ASSIGNEMNT: Data Structures Assignment 4

======Important Notes:============
- could not figure out how implement the remove a node function. so it does not do anything when selected.
- somehow my tree gets messed up, and not all of the nodes make it into the tree. The size and frequencies will be a little off because of this, not because i calculate them wrong, but because the tree does not contain the correct nodes. The calculation of the size and frequencies are correct for the tree that is inputted, but the pointers get messed up along the way and lose a few nodes here and there, so please do not doc me marks for all of that being wrong, just that all the nodes do not make it into the tree.
======Compilation/Running:==============
1: locate directory with all required files (avltree.c avl_tree.c avl_tree.h.c makefile) in terminal
2: type 'make' 
3: typing in './avltree' - runs question 1

======Sample Output:============ 
1. Initialization
2. Find
3. Insert
4. Remove
5. Check Height and Size
6. Find All (above a given frequency)
7. Exit
