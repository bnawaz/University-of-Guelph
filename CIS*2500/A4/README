You must copy these files to your own A4 folder.  

Be sure to put the files in the correct subdirectories.  

DO NOT CHANGE the contents of the linkedList.h file or the listTest.c file
YOU MUST call your linked list file linkedList.c

Your job is to write all of the required functions for the linkedList.c file (i.e. every function that is declared in linkedList.h) and then to write a music library program that uses your linked list.

You may use the listTest.c file to test your linkedList to make sure it is working.   type make test on the command line (assuming you copy the provided Makefile)
